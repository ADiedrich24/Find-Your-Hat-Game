# Find Your Hat Game

----------------------

Find your hat is a game used to pass time when you get bored. You select a game board of varying sizes based on difficulty level: easy, medium, or hard. Once you have chosen your level, the board appears with your character, a hat, and a number of holes based on the difficulty level, all in random locations. You then use the arrow keys or 'w, a, s, d' to move your character around the board to retrieve your hat without falling off the board or in a hole.

This is my second project in my journey of learning how to code. This project brought up a number of challenges for me which helped me learn how to manage a larger coding file. Including how to make minor and major changes in an efficient and readable way, how to test parts of the code, and also how to implement node packages. I also learned how to mix the use of readline and keypress events while recieving user input.
